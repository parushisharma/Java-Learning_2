Very good stress testing of your code.


Excellent readable data table.


Good user feedback in case of invalid range of years.


-0 Missing documentation of source code in Javadocs.
   First, comment your code, especially the new additions to your project,
   in the format required by the Javadocs generator: 
   Then for ease of reference, generate Javadocs based on your documentation.
	// This is a helper method that is private to the client. 
	// It inserts the data into the table
	private void addCountry(String country, double []num, int row) 
	{ ... }
	
	Change as follows:
	/**
	 * This is a helper method that is private to the client. â€¦[user friendly description]
	 * @param countryName  [Brief description]
	 * @param data  [Brief description]
	 */
	public  void addCountry (String countryName, double [] data)
